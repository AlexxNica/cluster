## About

The CNCF community cluster is deployed with the following intent in mind:

* Make available hardware for the community working on CNCF projects and related infrastructure.
* Make available hardware for the CNCF members needing to develop, debug and run cloud native software on relevant infrastructure at scale.
* Give users a staged path to first develop and test on a small scale and then at large.

## Submitting Requests

## Expectations

The following is expected from the CNCF cluster users:

* The cluster is used for the purposes of open source projects only. CNCF related projects and projects demonstrating intent of upstreaming code will be given priority.
* Users of the cluster preserve the rare value that the cluster represents: size and bare metal.
* Users do not tamper or misuse the infrastructure. The governance committee will closely monitor usage and WILL blacklist users or organizations from using the cluster if they detect any misuse or tampering.
* Users return the servers back to a well-defined and understood baseline post use.
* Users ensure that no proprietary software or data on the cluster is intentionally exposed.
* Neither CNCF nor Intel bears the responsibility for exposure of proprietary information under any circumstances.
* At this point, we do not expect any physical changes to be requested to the cluster. Hence, there is no expectation that there needs to be any on-site presence.
